# What is Digital Forensics?

Digital Forensic science is a branch of forensic science that focuses on the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices related to cybercrime. 

The term digital forensics was first used as a synonym for computer forensics. Since then, it has expanded to cover the investigation of any devices that can store digital data. 

Although the first computer crime was reported in 1978, followed by the Florida computers act, it wasn’t until the 1990s that it became a recognized term. 

It was only in the early 21st century that national policies on digital forensics emerged.

Or we could summarize it like this:

- An investigation takes place after an incident has happened.
- Try to answer questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and how.

# Digital Forensics Process:

The Digital Forensics process consists of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a legally acceptable manner. It involves the investigation of electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and networks to uncover data that may be relevant to criminal investigations or legal proceedings.
