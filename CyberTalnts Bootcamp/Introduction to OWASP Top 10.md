The Open Web Application Security Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to web application security vulnerabilities.

Also, it provides free documents, tools, articles, and sessions for WEB Application security.

# What is OWASP TOP 10?

It’s a regularly updated list of web security vulnerability categories that focus on the most critical risks.

## 1) Broken Access Control:

Definition: When users can access data or functions they shouldn’t.

Example: An employee accessing other employees' pay information.

## 2) Cryptographic Failures:

Definition: Problems with data encryption that lead to exposure.

Example: Sensitive data sent without proper encryption.

## 3) Injection:

Definition: Flawed code allowing harmful data inputs.

Example: SQL Injection, where attackers manipulate database queries.

## 4) Insecure Design:

Definition: Design flaws making systems vulnerable.

Example: Security controls are not included during the design phase.

## 5) Security Misconfiguration:

Definition: Incorrectly set up systems that become vulnerable.

Example: Default admin credentials not changed.

## 6) Vulnerable and Outdated Components:

Definition: Using old or unpatched software.

Example: Running an old version of a web server with known vulnerabilities.

## 7) Identification and Authentication Failures:

Definition: Weaknesses in user authentication processes.

Example: Easy-to-guess passwords or no multi-factor authentication.

## 8) Software and Data Integrity Failures:

Definition: Issues with unverified software updates and data integrity.

Example: Using software that hasn't been checked for tampering.

## 9) Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:

Definition: Inadequate logging and monitoring of security events.

Example: Failing to log and review unauthorized access attempts.

## 10) Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):

Definition: Attackers trick servers into making unauthorized requests.

Example: Sending requests to internal systems not intended to be exposed.
