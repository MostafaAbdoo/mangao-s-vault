# What is Network Traffic Interception (Traffic Sniffing)?

Network Traffic Interception, also known as Traffic Sniffing, is the process of capturing and analyzing packets of data as they travel across a network. This can be done using specialized software or hardware tools, and the primary objective is to monitor network activity, troubleshoot issues, or gather information for security purposes.

# Risks of Network Traffic Interception:

1. Data Theft: Unauthorized interception can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as passwords, personal data, and financial details.

2. Privacy Invasion: It can be used to eavesdrop on private communications, infringing on the privacy of individuals.

3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Attackers can intercept and/or alter the communication between two parties without their knowledge.

4. Network Downtime: Malicious sniffing can lead to network congestion and potential downtime.

5. Legal and Ethical Concerns: Unauthorized sniffing can result in legal repercussions and ethical dilemmas, especially in regulated environments.

# Common Tools for Network Traffic Interception and Analysis

## 1. Wireshark: 

[GUI] An open-source packet capture and analysis tool. It supports Windows, Linux, and OSs, and can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and protocol development.

## 2. tcpdump: 

[CLI] A command-line packet analyzer that allows users to capture and display packets being transmitted over a network.

## 3. Ettercap: 

[CLI+GUI] A comprehensive suite for MitM attacks on a LAN, featuring live connection interception and content filtering.

## 4. Tshark: 

[CLI] The command-line version of Wireshark, useful for scripting and automated analysis.

## 5. NetworkMiner: 

[GUI] A network forensics analysis tool (NFAT) for Windows that can parse and reconstruct captured network traffic.

# Common Network Traffic Interception Attacks and Techniques

## 1. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) [Attacks]:

A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other.

## 2. MAC Flooding [Techniques]:

Flood the CAM table with fake MAC addresses so it overflows the table, and the sniffing could be done. A technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. The attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended to go.

## 3. ARP Spoofing (ARP cache poisoning) [Techniques]:

A technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network (LAN). Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.  
Sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another host, effectively redirecting traffic to the attacker.

## 4. DNS Spoofing [DNS cache poisoning][Techniques]: 

A form of computer security hacking in which corrupt (Domain Name System) data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to any computer that the attacker chooses.  
Compromising the DNS server to redirect traffic to malicious sites by altering DNS responses.

## 5. SSL Stripping [Techniques]:

Downgrading a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection to intercept data.

  
A technique targeting secure communication between a user and a website. It takes advantage of the fact that most websites and online services use SSL/TLS encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted over the internet. An SSL strip attack downgrades a secure HTTPS connection to a non-secure HTTP connection, making it easier for cyber thieves to intercept and manipulate the data in transit between a web server and a client.

# How to Do Simple Network Traffic Interception and Analysis?

## Step-by-Step Guide Using Wireshark:

### 1. Install Wireshark:

Download and install Wireshark from the official website.

### 2. Start Wireshark:

Open Wireshark and select the network interface you want to monitor.

### 3. Capture Traffic:

Click on the "Start Capturing Packets" button (shark fin icon) to begin capturing network traffic on the selected interface.

### 4. Filter Traffic:

Use Wireshark’s filtering options to focus on specific traffic. For example, to filter HTTP traffic, use the filter http.

### 5. Analyze Packets:

Click on any packet to view its details. Wireshark provides a breakdown of each packet into several layers (e.g., Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP).

### 6. Follow Streams:

Right-click on a packet and select "Follow" -> "TCP Stream" to view the entire communication stream between two endpoints.

### 7. Save Capture:

Save your captured traffic for later analysis by going to File -> Save As and choosing a location and file format.

## Using tcpdump:

### 1. Install tcpdump:

On most Unix-like systems, tcpdump can be installed using the package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install tcpdump on Debian-based systems).

### 2. Capture Traffic:

Run tcpdump -i eth0 (replace eth0 with your network interface) to start capturing packets on the specified interface.

### 3. Filter Traffic:

Use various options to filter traffic. For example, tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 80 captures only HTTP traffic.

### 4. Save Capture:

Use the -w option to save captured packets to a file for later analysis, e.g., tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap.

# Important Considerations:

- Permissions: Both Wireshark and tcpdump typically require root or administrative privileges to capture packets on network interfaces.
- Legal and Ethical Use: Always ensure you have proper authorization before intercepting network traffic, as unauthorized interception can be illegal and unethical.
- Network Impact: Continuous capturing and analysis of network traffic can impact network performance, so use these tools wisely.

Understanding network traffic interception and analysis is crucial for identifying potential security threats and maintaining the integrity of network communications. Whether troubleshooting network issues or conducting security assessments, these skills are essential for IT and security professionals.
