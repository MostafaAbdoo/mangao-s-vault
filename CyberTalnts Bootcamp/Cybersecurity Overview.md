# What is Cybersecurity?

Cyber security is a branch of security that focuses on protecting systems, networks, computers, and data, from unauthorized access (intentional and unintentional), modification, or destruction.

## Importance of CyberSecurity

It is estimated that approximately 1 million potential cyberattacks are attempted per day, and with the evolution of mobile and cloud technologies, this number has the likelihood to increase.

The range of operations of cyber security involves protecting systems, applications, and data from major cyber threats. However, cyberthreats have become increasingly more innovative and the need for proper cyber defense to protect our data has never been more important.

The CIA triad (not to be confused with the US Central Intelligence Agency) is a security concept that guides the development of security systems and policies within an organization. 

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality is defined as the act of preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties. It also means ensuring that the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data is kept private and anonymous. 

Cracking poorly encrypted data and disclosing sensitive data are among the most common ways that confidentiality can be compromised.

Standard measures to establish confidentiality include: 

- Data encryption  
- Two-factor authentication  
- Biometric verification  
- Security tokens 

### Integrity 

This refers to the ability to protect a system and its information from being modified by unauthorized parties. A common integrity violation is when a [cyber attacker](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Attacker) [encrypts](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption) [sensitive](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Sensitive) or important corporation information and demands a ransom for the [data](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Data) to be restored. This is called [ransomware.](https://itlaw.wikia.org/wiki/Ransomware)

Standard measures to guarantee integrity include: 

- Cryptographic checksums  
- Using file permissions  
- Uninterrupted power supply 
- Data backups 

### Availability

This refers to the ability to guarantee that authorized parties can access systems, programs, and information when needed. The most common attack that impacts availability is Denial-of-Service(D-o-S) in which the attacker makes a system or network resource unavailable to legitimate users. 

The concept involves flooding a network with more traffic than it can handle which eventually leads to a crash.

Standard measures to guarantee availability include:  

- Backing up data to external drives  
- Implementing firewalls  
- Having backup power supplies  
- Data redundancy
- Network monitoring

## Layered Cybersecurity Approach

While every company system and network is different, the layered cybersecurity model strives to serve as a basis for which companies can lay their security policies.

These are systems, applications, and data whose failure, disruption or if compromised would cause a major crisis within the organization.

Physical Security 

This security layer addresses security concerns in regards to the physical properties of a system. This includes the physical cutting of cables, natural disasters, and other forms of human vandalism.

Data Security

This involves the security controls in charge of the storage and transfer of data. Application Security 

This layer protects and controls access to an application, an application’s access to the mission-critical assets, and the internal security of the application. Endpoint Security

This ensures that the connection between endpoints of user devices and the network is not vulnerable to breaches or exploitation.

Network Security

This protection layer controls and prevents unauthorized access to the network. Human Layer

We are the weakest link in any cyber security posture. Human security controls protect mission-critical assets from a variety of human threats, including cybercriminals, malicious insiders, and negligent users.

# Cybercrime

## Introduction to Cybercrime

Cybercrime refers to criminal activities that involve computers, networks, or digital devices. Unlike traditional crimes, cybercrimes leverage the anonymity, speed, and global reach of the internet to target individuals, organizations, or even governments. 

As technology has become integral to our lives, the prevalence and sophistication of cybercrime have escalated, posing significant threats to privacy, financial security, and national security.

## Key Types of Cybercrime

Cybercrime can be categorized into several types, each with unique methods, targets, and consequences:

### 1) Hacking (without permission)

Description: Hacking involves unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or human behavior to gain control or extract information.

Impact: Can lead to data breaches, identity theft, financial loss, and damage to a company’s reputation.

Example: The Equifax data breach in 2017, where sensitive information of over 147 million people was compromised.

### 2) Identity Theft

Description: Identity theft occurs when a cybercriminal steals personal information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, or login credentials, to commit fraud.

Impact: Victims may face financial loss, damaged credit, and long-term difficulties in restoring their identity.

Example: A cybercriminal using stolen credit card information to make unauthorized purchases.

### 3) Phishing and Social Engineering (without permission)

Description: Phishing is a type of social engineering where attackers deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.

Impact: Can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized access to systems.

Example: An email that appears to be from a bank, asking the recipient to verify their account by clicking a malicious link.

### 4) Ransomware

Description: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data, demanding payment for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid, the data may be permanently lost or publicly released.

Impact: Significant financial loss, operational disruption, and potential loss of critical data.

Example: The WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, which affected over 230,000 computers across 150 countries.

### 5) Financial Fraud

Description: Financial fraud involves using digital means to illegally obtain money or assets. This includes online banking fraud, credit card fraud, and investment scams.

Impact: Can cause substantial financial damage to individuals and businesses.

Example: A phishing scheme that tricks users into revealing their online banking credentials.

### 6) Cyberstalking and Harassment

Description: Cyberstalking and harassment involve using the internet to stalk, intimidate, or harass individuals. This can include sending threatening messages, spreading false information, or unauthorized surveillance.

Impact: Psychological trauma, reputational damage, and in severe cases, physical harm.

Example: An individual repeatedly sending threatening emails to another person.

### 7) Intellectual Property Theft

Description: Intellectual property theft occurs when a cybercriminal illegally accesses or copies copyrighted materials, trade secrets, or patented information.

Impact: Loss of revenue, competitive advantage, and legal complications.

Example: A hacker stealing and selling a company's proprietary software code.

### 8) Espionage

Description: Cyber espionage involves the unauthorized access to confidential information, typically for political or military advantage. State-sponsored actors often conduct these attacks.

Impact: National security threats, diplomatic tensions, and loss of sensitive information.

Example: The 2020 SolarWinds cyberattack, believed to be orchestrated by a nation-state, which targeted U.S. government agencies.

### 9) Cyberterrorism

Description: Cyberterrorism is the use of the internet to conduct violent acts that threaten or cause harm to people or property, often to achieve political, religious, or ideological objectives.

Impact: Public safety risks, disruption of critical infrastructure, and widespread fear.

Example: Attacks on critical infrastructure such as power grids, water supplies, or transportation systems.

### 10) Dark Web Activities

Description: The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and is often associated with illegal activities. Cybercriminals use the dark web to trade in illegal goods and services, including drugs, weapons, stolen data, and hacking tools.

Impact: Facilitates global cybercrime, making it harder for law enforcement to track and prevent illegal activities.

Example: Marketplaces on the dark web selling stolen credit card information.

# Legal and Regulatory Framework

Governments worldwide have implemented various laws and regulations to combat cybercrime:

## 1) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

A European Union regulation that strengthens data protection and privacy for individuals, with strict requirements for how personal data is handled.

## 2) Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

A U.S. law that criminalizes unauthorized access to computers and the use of computers for fraudulent purposes.

## 3) Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)

A U.S. law that facilitates the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between the government and private sector to enhance collective defense.

## 4) Budapest Convention on Cybercrime

An international treaty aimed at harmonizing laws and fostering cooperation to combat cybercrime across borders.

# Cybersecurity Tips

## The old firewall solution

There are limitations to its blocking capabilities, the firewall is still a good tool that you can use to filter your Internet traffic, and block communication from an infected machine or online location. 

## Get a good antivirus

You still need a good antivirus to catch most malware, block phishing threats and check the web reputation of popular online domains. 

## Use Anti-spyware solutions

Spyware is software that monitors your Internet traffic and uses your personal information against you. To stay safe from spyware, there are a few popular anti-spyware products, like Malwarebytes or Spybot Search and Destroy that you can choose from.

## Use automatic update tools for vulnerable applications

By using security holes in unpatched applications, cybercriminals manage to spread exploits that deliver financial and data-stealing malware on the affected systems. For this reason, it is important to have the most up-to-date security patches available and this may be done by using a free solution that automatically updates your system.

## Use a password manager

It is easy to forget the numerous passwords you have set. To avoid this issue, most people simply choose to use only one or two passwords all the time. But, this makes you vulnerable to hackers because all they need to do is to crack your password and have access to all your online accounts. 

That’s because not all these online accounts incorporate high-security standards to protect our passwords. A password manager is the safest bet to keep all your unique passwords.

## Backup your system and sensitive information

To keep sensitive information secure from cyber-criminals, a backup solution is the best option you have. So, in case your system is blocked by ransomware that stops you from accessing it, you’ll format the system and use your backup to restore it. 

You can use one of the available backup solutions or you can keep the most important data in the cloud and access it from any location and any device. 

## Encrypt your important files

By encrypting your personal information you ensure cybercriminals will not access your confidential data, even if they gain access to your OS. You can also encrypt files on your local disk or in an online location, which makes things harder for any hacker.

## Protect your online traffic by using multiple tools

Use a VPN solution to encrypt your online connection or Use the Tor browser that allows you to browse the internet anonymously by sending your communication through the Tor network of computers.

However, to improve your online protection, you cannot rely on a single solution, you rather need to understand that multiple means and guidelines need to be followed.

## Stay up-to-date on Cybersecurity tools

While you may consider yourself presently cyber-secure by applying all these tips, future events may change your opinion. Learn to adopt new tools to protect against phishing attempts, spam campaigns, malicious web pages, and cybercriminal attacks.

# The Future of Cybersecurity

Presently, the need for better cyber security methods has reached all-time high importance because of ever-increasing cyber threats. The evolution of cyber threats and their scale of destruction in recent years has brought about a change in the perception of cyber security and has proven the need for an active and dynamic cyber security infrastructure.

While providing cybersecurity for large entities such as the government is becoming harder, Individuals should take precautions such as using licensed antivirus software, using an active firewall, not entering untrusted websites, not downloading any files from untrusting websites, and not sharing every information everywhere. Individuals should use websites that’s URL addresses start with “HTTPS” and they should scan their files. 

The most important factor in cyber security is “human”. Humans are the weakest link of cyber security. Therefore, providing training about cyber security to users of computer technologies should be a priority.

Although there is no way to know precisely what the future of cybersecurity holds, it will likely be full of innovation and improvements. As technology advances, so does the need for better cybersecurity solutions. 

The demand for Cyber Security professionals has increased significantly in the last few years making a career in cybersecurity very promising.
