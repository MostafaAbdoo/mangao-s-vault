- 📡 **Unicast**: Direct one-to-one communication between two devices.
  - Web surfing or File Transfer
  - For a Single Communication whether it's IPv4 or IPv6
- 🌐 **Multicast**: Efficiently sends data to multiple devices simultaneously.
  - For Multimedia, stock exchange
  - Difficult to scale across large network
- 📦 **Anycast**: Data sent to one of many devices, typically the closest one.
  - Anycast typically routes incoming traffic to the nearest data center with the capacity to process the request efficiently. Selective routing allows an Anycast network to be resilient in the face of high traffic volume, network congestion, and DDoS attacks
- 🔊 **Broadcast**: One-to-all communication, reaching all devices in a local network.
  - used in IPv4 not IPv6
  - Routing Updates, ARP Requests

# Wireless Networking

Wireless networking standards, managed by IEEE, enable connectivity across devices, with evolving technologies like Wi-Fi and 5G enhancing performance.
- 🌐 **IEEE Standards**: Wireless networks follow IEEE’s 802.11 standards for interoperability.
- 📶 **Wi-Fi Generations**: Wi-Fi names like Wi-Fi 6 simplify understanding of network standards.
