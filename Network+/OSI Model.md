1. **Application Layer**:
    
    - Provides network services to applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients).
        
    - Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH, etc.
        
2. **Transport Layer**:
    
    - Ensures reliable data delivery and error checking.
        
    - Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
        
3. **Internet Layer**:
    
    - Handles addressing, routing, and packet forwarding between devices.
        
    - Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP, ARP, etc.
        
4. **Network Access Layer (Link Layer)**:
    
    - Deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium.
        
    - Includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and hardware addressing (MAC addresses).
