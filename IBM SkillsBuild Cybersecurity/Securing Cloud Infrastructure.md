# Threats

- **Mismanaged identities** : Misused access credentials are now the top technique used in data breaches.  Most attackers are steadily targeting the company directory and the identity infrastructure with phenomenal success. Identity is a key target across unsecured networks. When attackers have your credentials, they can use them to gain access across multiple sites.
    - **Identity governance and administration (IGA)** is a solution that helps organizations manage the identity lifecycle of users and their access to critical applications and data. It provides automated and streamlined workflows for creating, approving, modifying, and revoking user access.
    - **Privileged access management (PAM)** is a solution that provides secure and controlled access to privileged accounts, such as those of system administrators, to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM)** solutions enable organizations to understand their entitlements and permissions by analyzing and mapping all identities, roles, groups, and policies across multiple cloud platforms.
    - **The principle of least privilege (POLP)** must be enforced across all environments, where users have only the necessary permissions to perform their jobs and nothing more.
- **Cloud misconfiguration** : Incorrect configurations of cloud infrastructure remain one of the top causes of cloud computing security breaches worldwide.
- **Denial-of-service (DoS)**
- **Insider threats**
- **Reduced infrastructure visibility** 
- **Shadow IT** is the use of unauthorized or unsanctioned technology solutions in an organization, often outside the purview of the IT department. Shadow IT can include the use of personal devices, software applications, or cloud services that the IT department has not approved. An example of shadow IT is employees using personal cloud storage accounts, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, to store company data.
- **Insecure application programming interfaces (API)** 
- **Compliance violations**

**Identity access management (IAM)** involves managing users’ identities and controlling their access to applications, networks, and other resources. IAM includes identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting (IAAA).
**Data loss prevention (DLP)** is a set of tools and processes that help organizations protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure or use by detecting and preventing data breaches in real time.
**Cloud disaster recovery** is a service that enables organizations to replicate and recover their critical applications and data in the cloud in the event of an IT outage or disaster, ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime.
**On-demand scalability** refers to the ability of a system or application to quickly and easily adjust its computing resources to meet changing demands or workloads.
**cloud application** is a type of software application that runs in the cloud infrastructure. Users can access and operate cloud applications entirely online without installing software or hardware on a local computer.
**Cloud application security** involves using application-level policies, tools, technologies, and protocols to maintain comprehensive visibility into all cloud-based resources, defend against cyberattacks, and restrict access solely to authorized users.
**Microservices** are a type of architecture used in cloud applications where a software system is broken down into small, independent components that communicate with each other through APIs.
**Cloud application security solutions** :
- **cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP)** is a security solution to protect cloud-native applications. CNAPPs provide comprehensive protection and visibility for applications built using microservices, containers, and other cloud-native technologies.
- **cloud access security broker (CASB)** acts as a firewall for cloud services, providing a gateway for enforcing security policies to ensure that authorized users’ actions adhere to the company’s security policies.
- **Cloud security posture management (CSPM)** is a critical component of cloud application security that helps organizations identify and mitigate potential security risks by using the following techniques: Advanced automation ,Monitoring and Threat detection techniques
