# Malware types

**virus** is malware that attaches to a device’s files or programs to replicate itself and then spreads to another device.
Viruses need user interaction to run
**Worms**, like viruses, are malware that infects and spreads across systems. But unlike viruses, worms self-replicate.
**trojan** is a seemingly helpful program designed to give an attacker access to your device secretly.
**Ransomware** is malware that holds your system hostage. It infects the system, restricts your access to the system or its data, and instructs you to pay a ransom to regain access.
**logic bomb** is malware saved in a file or embedded in software that activates only when specific conditions are met.
**Spyware** is malware installed secretly on a device or system to collect and report data.
**Adware**, short for advertising-supported software, is software that automatically displays unsolicited advertisements.

**Shoulder surfing** is when an attacker steals your personal information by looking over your shoulder as you use a computer or device.
