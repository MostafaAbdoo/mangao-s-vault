**security operations center (SOC)** is a dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals that uses specialized software to actively monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to an organization’s potential security threats and incidents in real time.
**SOC team** is a group of cybersecurity professionals responsible for monitoring and analyzing an organization’s security posture. The team uses various SOC tools and techniques to identify and respond to threats quickly.
**SOC software** is a type of security software that SOC teams use to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats in real time. SOC software typically provides a centralized dashboard to help the SOC team monitor and detect suspicious activity across an organization’s IT infrastructure.
**SOC facility** is a centralized physical location where cybersecurity professionals monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents and threats.
## SOC models
- **in-house SOC**, or on-premises SOC, an organization has an internal SOC team and resources dedicated to managing security operations.
- **virtual SOC (V-SOC)** is like an in-house SOC, but centralized management of security operations happens in the cloud. An organization builds, hosts, and maintains its security infrastructure and tools in the cloud, and the organization’s internal SOC team works remotely.
- **SOC as a service (SOCaaS)** is cloud-based. But with SOCaas, the organization outsources nearly **all** its security operations to a third-party provider, including the SOC team.
- **hybrid SOC** combines in-house SOC and SOCaaS models. With a hybrid SOC, organizations can use in-house resources and outsourced security services.
A SOC team’s responsibilities fall into three general categories: 
    Preparing, planning, preventing
    Monitoring, detecting, responding 
    Recovery, refinement, compliance
Cybersecurity professionals use the term **security posture** to describe the overall strength and effectiveness of an organization’s security measures and practices.
A security posture is like a fortress for an organization. Just like a well-built fortress with strong walls, guards, and gates, a strong security posture means an organization has robust security measures and policies to protect its valuable assets and information from potential attacks. It creates a solid defense system that fortifies the organization’s defenses against security threats, just as a fortress protects its inhabitants from external threats.

**Compliance training** focuses on teaching employees about the laws, regulations, and industry-specific requirements that govern data protection and privacy. Compliance training aims to prevent violations and reduce risks.
**Onboarding training** focuses on an organization’s security requirements, risks, and protocols before accessing sensitive information and systems. Onboarding training sets a solid foundation of security knowledge for new employees.
**Phishing training** targets the growing threat of phishing attacks, which aim to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
**Recurring training** reinforces security awareness among employees by being offered frequently and on a recurring basis. It serves as a reminder of security practices, updates employees about new threats and policies, and refreshes their understanding of cybersecurity basics.
