**Incident response (IR)** comprises the set of actions an organization takes to prepare for, expose, and stop cyberattacks. It also includes repairing any damage that comes from the attack and collecting data
An **incident response framework** provides a structure to support incident response operations. A framework typically provides guidance on what needs to be done but not on how it is done. A framework is also flexible enough to let organizations add or remove elements as necessary to satisfy their needs.
A **precursor** is a sign that an incident might occur in the future, such as a web server log entry showing the use of a port scanner.
An **indicator** is a sign that an incident might have occurred or is occurring now, such as an antimalware program alert indicating that a trojan has infected a device.
**Containment** describes the process of stopping an attack from proceeding further and causing any more damage or disablement to the system.
**Eradication** is the process of eliminating the threat from all affected devices. For example, eradication can involve reimaging devices, disabling services, and updating software.
In **recovery**, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems function normally, and close any vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents.
An **attack surface** encompasses all the points in a system’s components, access points, and other places where an attacker can try to enter, affect, or extract data from the system.
- Preparing
- Detection and analysis
- Containment and eradication
- Recovery
**Intrusion analysis** is the process of using information about an attack to determine the scope of the attack, the method used by the attacker to gain access, and the extent of the damage to the system or network.
The **MITRE ATT&CK** framework is a valuable resource in intrusion analysis. It can help analysts identify how attackers gained access to networks, what tools they used, and what steps they took to execute the attack.
The **Cyber Kill Chain framework** is another valuable tool for intrusion analysis. Like the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Cyber Kill Chain framework provides a structure to identify, understand, isolate, and respond to malicious behavior.
