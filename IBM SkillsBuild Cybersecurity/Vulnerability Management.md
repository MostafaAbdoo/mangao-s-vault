**Threat intelligence** is intelligence that helps organizations make informed decisions about cybersecurity threats.

## Types of threat intelligence
**Strategic intelligence** is high-level intelligence about current worldwide trends in cyberthreats.
**Tactical intelligence** is intelligence that helps security teams detect and respond to cyberattacks in real time.
**Operational intelligence** is intelligence that helps security teams anticipate and prevent future attacks.

# **Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)**

STIX is an open-source programming language that provides a standardized format for sharing threat intelligence.
The language treats each piece of information as a block of code called an **object**. 

- Each object has a property called **type** that indicates the threat intelligence concept relevant to the object, such as “attack pattern”, “threat actor”, or “location”. 
    
- Other properties represent characteristics such as the object’s **name** and **description**. For example, an object’s **type** might be “attack pattern”, and its **name** might be “spear phishing”.
### Common STIX object types
- **Attack pattern** “A type of TTP [tactics, techniques, and procedures] that describes ways that adversaries try to compromise their targets”
- **Campaign** “A grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur over a period of time against a specific set of targets”
- **Course of action** “A recommendation from a producer of intelligence to a consumer on the actions that they might take in response to that intelligence”
- **Identity** Specific individuals, organizations, or groups that have been targeted, such as the finance sector
- **Indicator** “Contains a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyberactivity”
- **Location** “Represents a geographic location”
- **Malware** A type of TTP that represents malicious code
- **Threat actor** “Actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent”
- **Tool** “Software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks”
- **Vulnerability** “A mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network”
- **Relationship** Links together two objects to describe how they are related

STIX expressions come in **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**, a standard text-based data format.
```json
{ 

“type”: “indicator”, 

“id”: “indicator--2f54e292-8b64-4495-bc02-6a9198a365e3”, 

“created”: “2022-02-01T08:08:15.000Z”, 

“modified”: “2023-02-15T08:08:15.000Z”, 

“pattern”: “[file:hashes.MD5 = ‘d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e’]”, 

“valid_from”: “2022-03-15T08:08:15.000Z”, 

“labels”: [“malware”], 

“name”: “Empty file MD5 hash”, 

“description”: “Indicates the presence of an empty file with an MD5 hash value of d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e which is a common tactic used by malware authors to evade detection.” 

}
```

The **type** property specifies the STIX object’s type, such as _relationship_, _vulnerability_, _indicator_, or _attack pattern_. 
The **created** property is a timestamp indicating when the object was created.
The **modified** property is a timestamp indicating when the object was last modified.
The **pattern** property identifies a detection pattern.
The **valid_from** property is specific to indicator objects. It specifies when the indicator was first considered a valid pattern to associate with a malicious activity.
The **labels** property indicates one or more preset terms for describing the object.
The **description** property describes the object in natural language, not code.

-----------------
**vulnerability assessment** is a systematic process in which you identify and evaluate system, network, or application vulnerabilities to determine security risk.

Vulnerability assessments include four steps:
- **identification**
- **analysis**
- **prioritization**
- **remediation**

## **How to prioritize**
You prioritize vulnerabilities manually or with vulnerability management software. Either way, you rate them using a scoring or ranking system.
- **Moderate vulnerabilities** pose a small risk to systems or data. Attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities, but doing so will lead only to minor consequences.
- **High vulnerabilities** pose a large risk to systems and data. If attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, the consequences might be notable enough to cause reputational damage.
- **Critical vulnerabilities** pose a severe risk to systems and data. Attackers can easily exploit these vulnerabilities and cause significant damage
-----------------
Vulnerability assessment reports take various forms. Typically, they include the components shown in the example:
- **Summary:** An introduction that summarizes the assessment
- **Findings:** A descriptive list of each vulnerability ordered from most to least severe
- **Recommendations:** A list of recommended controls listed in the same order as the vulnerabilities
- **Conclusion:** A conclusion that summarizes the findings and recommendations

**vulnerability scanner** is an application that scans a system for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software, missing patches, misconfigured settings, or weak passwords.
**Vulnerability management services** provide a more comprehensive solution than scanners alone. These services usually involve two components: scanning tools and vulnerability assessment professionals.

----
**Penetration testing** is a type of security testing that simulates real hacking techniques to find application, network, or system vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

A penetration tester is a type of ethical hacker. People often use the terms interchangeably, but they don’t mean the same thing.
**ethical hacker**, or **offensive security researcher**, is a hacker who works with organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities, not exploit them for malicious purposes.

Ethical hackers use various methods, such as malware analysis and risk assessment. Pen testing is only one of many tools that an ethical hacker might use. In short, all pen testers are ethical hackers, but not all ethical hackers are pen testers.
## Phases of penetration testing
- **Planning
- **Information gathering
- **Testing
- **Reporting**

## **Planning**
- **Determine The Scope
- **Determine The Objectives
- **Gather information about target systems
- **Develop a test plan
- **Obtain authorization**

**Rules of engagement** : A verbal agreement about the plan and scope of testing isn’t enough. Because of pen testing’s disruptive nature and potential consequences, the tester and the client must reach a legal agreement before testing begins. Generally, this agreement includes a rules of engagement contract that the pen tester and the client’s authorized representative must sign. 

This document outlines the scope of pen testing and typically includes the following information.
What to test - What not to test - When to test - How to share results - How to prove test succeeded
## **Information gathering**
- **Footprinting or reconnaissance** : the pen tester profiles the system and its users. For example, they might collect the network’s IP addresses and domain names and determine its topology.
-  **enumeration** : the pen tester uses tools to probe the system for data about active hosts and services on a network. Some examples of this data include operating systems (OSs), device names, usernames, and web server details.
- **Vulnerability scanning** : The pen tester uses a vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerabilities in the active hosts and services discovered through enumeration.
- **Analysis and reporting**
