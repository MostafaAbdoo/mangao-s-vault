**Governance** is the set of policies, standards, and frameworks that a company uses to achieve its business goals.
**Compliance** involves implementing administrative, physical, and technical controls to ensure that business activities stay aligned with applicable laws and standards.
**Risk** involves the exposure of something valuable, such as confidential data, to possible damage or loss. All businesses face financial, legal, strategic, and security risks. Good risk management helps businesses assess risk and find ways to mitigate potential damage.


Governance uses an information security framework containing four documents: policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures.
**Policies**
Broad statements about the overall intent of the company and how it should run
**Standards and guidelines**
Provide specific requirements for a given area or technology
**Procedures**
Define step-by-step processes for implementing standards and guidelines

**Risk management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling financial, legal, strategic, and security risks to an organization’s capital and earnings.
**Risk assessment** is a process in which you identify risks, evaluate their impact, and decide what to do about them.

**Compliance** :
- **standard**
- **regulation**, like a law, is a legal requirement that organizations must follow. But a government agency, not legislators, creates a regulation, and a regulation’s purpose is to interpret and implement the law. Regulations provide more detail to clarify what organizations must do to stay within the law. Non-compliance with regulations, as with laws, can lead to penalties, fines, and other legal consequences.
- **law** is a legal requirement established by a congress, parliament, or other legislative group
