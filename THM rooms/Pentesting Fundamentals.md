**Rules of Engagement (ROE)**
The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?).

Permission : This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities they carry out.
Test Scope: This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.|
Rules : The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

## Penetration testing stages
**Information Gathering** : This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organization as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.

**Enumeration/Scanning** : This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

**Exploitation** : This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

**Privilege Escalation** : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

**Post-exploitation** : This stage involves a few sub-stages:  
**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
**3.**  Covering your tracks
**4.** Reporting

## OSSTMM
[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://github.com/mtesauro/owasp-wte/blob/master/temp-projects/wte-docs/contents/usr/share/doc/WTE-Documentation/OSSTMM/OSSTMM.3.pdf) provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.
The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
1. Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
2. Wired Networks
3. Wireless communications

## OWASP
The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.
The foundation regularly [writes reports](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/) stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honorable mention because of its popularity and detail.
The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organizations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

##  NCSC CAF
The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organization's defenses against these.
The framework applies to organizations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:
- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning
