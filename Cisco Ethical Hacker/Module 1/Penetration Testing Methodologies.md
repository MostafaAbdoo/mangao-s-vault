# ***Network Infrastructure Tests***

This often includes the switches, routers, firewalls, and supporting resources, such as authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) servers and IPSs.
a wireless security tester would attempt to break into a network via the wireless network either by bypassing security mechanisms or breaking the cryptographic methods used to secure the traffic.

# ***Application-Based Tests***

These weaknesses can include but are not limited to misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws. Because a web application is typically built on a web server with a back-end database, the testing scope normally includes the database as well.

# ***Penetration Testing in the Cloud***

The responsibility for cloud security depends on the type of cloud model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).Regardless of the model used, cloud security is the responsibility of both the client and the cloud provider. These details need to be worked out before a cloud computing contract is signed. These contracts vary depending on the security requirements of the client.
you want to ensure that the CSP has the same layers of security (logical, physical, and administrative) in place that you would have for services you control. When performing penetration testing in the cloud, you must understand what you can do and what you cannot do. Most CSPs have detailed guidelines on how to perform security assessments and penetration testing in the cloud. Regardless, there are many potential threats when organizations move to a cloud model. For example, although your data is in the cloud, it must reside in a physical location somewhere.

# **Unknown-Environment Test***

the tester is typically provided only a very limited amount of information. he idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester start out with the perspective that an external attacker might have.

# **Known-Environment Test***

the tester starts out with a significant amount of information about the organization and its infrastructure. The tester would normally be provided things like network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, and a set of user credentials. If the scope includes an application assessment, the tester might also be provided the source code of the target application. The idea of this type of test is to identify as many security holes as possible. the scope is typically much broader and includes internal network configuration auditing and scanning of desktop computers for defects.

# **Partially Known Environment Test***

the testers may be provided credentials but not full documentation of the network infrastructure. This would allow the testers to still provide results of their testing from the perspective of an external attackerâ€™s point of view. Considering the fact that most compromises start at the client and work their way throughout the network.
