One of the most important phases of any penetration testing engagement is the planning and preparation phase. During this phase, you clearly scope your engagement.
The following are some key concepts you must address and understand in the planning and preparation phase:
- The target audience
- The rules of engagement
- The communication escalation path and communication channels
- The available resources and requirements
- The overall budget for the engagement
- Any specific disclaimers
- Any technical constraints
- The resources available to you as a penetration tester
# Regulatory Compliance Considerations

Let’s start to review these considerations by assuming that you are hired to perform a compliance-based assessment. In that scenario, you (the penetration tester) are hired to verify and audit the security posture of the organization and to make sure the organization is compliant with specific regulations, such as:
- PCI DSS: aims to secure the processing of credit card payments and other types of digital payments
- HIPAA: to simplify and standardize healthcare administrative processes
- FedRAMP: to authorize the use of cloud service offerings
- GDPR: privacy
Most of these regulations and specifications require the regulated company to hire third-party penetration testing firms to make sure they are compliant and to ensure that their security posture is acceptable. You must be familiar with these regulations if you are hired to perform penetration testing to verify compliance and the overall security posture of the organization.
# Local Restrictions
You should be aware of any local restrictions when you are hired to perform penetration testing. For instance, you may be traveling abroad to a different country where there may be specific country limitations and local laws that may restrict whether you can perform some tasks as a penetration tester. Penetration testing laws vary from country to country. Some penetration testers have been accused and even arrested for allegedly violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of America Section 1030(a)(5)(B). You must always have clear documentation from your client (the entity that hired you) indicating that you have permission to perform the testing. Clearly, some of these limitations and considerations may have a direct impact to your contract and statement of work (SOW).
the following are a few examples of constraints that you might face during a penetration testing engagement:

- Certain areas and technologies that cannot be tested due to operational limitations (For instance, you might not be able to launch specific SQL injection attacks, as doing so might corrupt a production database.)
- Technologies that might be specific for the organization being tested
- Limitation of skill sets
- Limitation of known exploits
- Systems that are categorized as out of scope because of the criticality or known performance problems
# Legal Concepts
- ***Service-level agreement (SLA)*** : An SLA is a well-documented expectation or constraint related to one or more of the minimum and/or maximum performance measures (such as quality, timeline/timeframe, and cost) of the penetration testing service
- ***Confidentiality***
- ***Statement of work (SOW)***: An SOW is a document that specifies the activities to be performed during a penetration testing engagement, The SOW can be a standalone document or can be part of a **_master service agreement (MSA)_**.
- **_master service agreement (MSA)_**: MSAs, which are very popular today, are contracts that can be used to quickly negotiate the work to be performed. When a master agreement is in place, the same terms do not have to be renegotiated every time you perform work for a customer. MSAs are especially beneficial when you perform a penetration test, and you know that you will be rehired on a recurring basis to perform additional tests in other areas of the company or to verify that the security posture of the organization has been improved as a result of prior testing and remediation.
- ***Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)*** : An NDA is a legal document and contract between you and an organization that has hired you as a penetration tester. An NDA specifies and defines confidential material, knowledge, and information that should not be disclosed and that should be kept confidential by both parties
